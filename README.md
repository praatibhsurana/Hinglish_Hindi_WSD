<p> üìå A pipeline for transliteration of Hinglish code mixed data to Hindi Devanagari script, spell correction, POS tagging and word sense disambiguation of the Hindi Devanagari script.       
</p>  

<p>  
üìñ With this package, we aim to tackle the problem of word sense disambiguation by making atleast the preliminary steps a lot easier. The problem statement we decided to tackle was the translation of Hinglish code mixed data to Hindi Devanagari and then to carry out word sense disambiguation on the Hindi text. We make use of libraries such as <a href='https://github.com/hellohaptik/spello'>spello</a>, <a href='https://github.com/indic-transliteration/indic_transliteration_py'>indic-transliteration</a>, <a href='https://github.com/riteshpanjwani/pyiwn'>pyiwn</a> and <a href='https://github.com/avineshpvs/indic_tagger'>indic_tagger</a>.   
</p>  <br>

## üí° Functionalities

**hindiwsd will mainly carry out the following tasks for now:**

- Hinglish to Hindi transliteration 
- Spell correction of Hindi text
- POS tagging of Hindi text 
- Word Sense Disambiguation of Hindi text with the help of IndoWordNet
- Enhanced Lesk's Algorithm using custom dataset

<br>

## üíæ Installation 
**Install hindiwsd via 'pip'**
```bash  
pip install hindiwsd
```  

<br>

## üóíÔ∏è NOTE
1) **A small change will need to be made to iwn.py from the pyiwn library before using our package** <br> 

- There is a missing try-catch block in iwn.py that might cause our package to crash 
- Here's a quick fix, use our patched [iwn.py](https://github.com/praatibhsurana/pyiwn/blob/patch-1/pyiwn/iwn.py) instead. Copy it's contents and replace the original iwn.py. 
- The path to the original iwn.py would be **path-to-your-env-or-python-folder/lib/site-packages/pyiwn/iwn.py**

<br>

## üìÑ CUSTOM DATASET FOR ENHANCED LESK'S ALGORITHM
**The custom dataset is available [here](https://github.com/praatibhsurana/Hinglish_Hindi_WSD/tree/main/dataset).**
- Here is a preview of what it looks like <br><br>

<br>

## ‚ö°Getting Started
### üî§ Word Sense Disambiguation
- **The wordsense() function from the hindi_wsd.py script.** 
**It prints out the Hindi Devanagari spell corrected sentence, POS tags and disambiguated word meanings for each word in the sentence available on the [IndoWordNet](https://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/indowordnet/).** 

```python  
>>> from hindiwsd import hindi_wsd  
>>> print(hindi_wsd.wordsense("aaj achha din hai"))   
```  

- **You can also directly feed in Hindi sentences to the wordsense() function.**
```python  
>>> from hindiwsd import hindi_wsd  
>>> print(hindi_wsd.wordsense("‡§Ü‡§ú ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§® ‡§π‡•à"))   
```

<br>

### üè∑Ô∏è POS tagging for Hindi Devanagari
- **Getting POS tags for a Hindi sentence using the POS_tagger() function from the wsd.py script. Returns a list of tuples containing word and respective tag(NOUN, ADJECTIVE, ADVERB, VERB).**
```python  
>>> from hindiwsd import wsd  
>>> print(wsd.POS_tagger('‡§Ü‡§ú ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§® ‡§π‡•à'))   
```

<br>

### üìö Hinglish to Hindi transliteration with spell correction
- **Transliterating the Hinglish code mixed sentence to Hindi Devanagari using the preprocess_transliterate() function from the wsd.py script. Returns two strings. The first is the spell corrected Hinglish sentence followed by the spell corrected Hindi sentence.** 
```python  
>>> from hindiwsd import wsd  
>>> print(wsd.preprocess_transliterate('aaj achha din hai'))   
```

With the advent of IndoWordnet, we can explore important tasks such as word sense disambiguation, word similarity, and cross-lingual information retrieval, and carry out effective research regarding the same. In this paper, we worked on improving word sense disambiguation for 20 of the most common ambiguous Hindi words by making use of knowledge-based methods. We also came up with √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhindiwsd√¢‚Ç¨¬ù, an easy-to-use framework developed in Python that acts as a pipeline for transliteration of Hinglish code-mixed text followed by spell correction, POS tagging, and word sense disambiguation of Hindi text. We also curated a dataset of these 20 most used ambiguous Hindi words. This dataset was then used to enhance a modified Lesk's algorithm and more accurately carry out word sense disambiguation. We achieved an accuracy of about 71\% using our customized Lesk√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s algorithm which was an improvement to the accuracy of about 34\% using the original Lesk√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s algorithm on the test set.},
